# csc865-autograding-tools
Two Python tools to automate the grading and plagiarism-checking process for Berkeley's AI assignments. Designed to work with iLearn's submission download structure, but can be easily modified to work with any codebase.

Uses Moss (http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) with Mosspy to assess plagiarism for student submissions.
