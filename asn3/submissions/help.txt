Place all student submissions here, directly as they are downloaded from iLearn.

For instance, with two sections, the structure should look something like this:

v asn1
    v submissions
        > CSC066501-S22...
        > CSC066502-S22...
        > subgrader

The "CSC066501-S22..." should be directories, not .zip files. The submissions themselves,
however, can and should be zip files. 

Don't touch the subgrader unless something is truly broken.
